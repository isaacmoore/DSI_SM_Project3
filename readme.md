# Project 3: Liquor Sales + Linear Regression

### Overview
This week we learned we learned how to use scikit-learn to run linear regression models, how Goals & Business Objectives translate to Model Fit, and also how to optimize models using cross-validation. We worked a lot with housing data and predicting prices. Now we're going to use these skills to dig into a rich set of data!
